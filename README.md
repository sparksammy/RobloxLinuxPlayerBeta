# RobloxLinuxPlayerBeta
It's forever in beta, just like the original. :)

Be sure edit the script so that it has the folder that RobloxPlayerBeta is in where the "folderplayer" string is.
Also: Make sure that Wine is installed, and OpenGL is your rendering selection!

Depends on: wininet winhttp vcrun2008 pdh, install via "winetricks"
