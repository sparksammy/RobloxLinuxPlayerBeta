# RobloxLinuxPlayerBeta
It's forever in beta, just like the original. :)

Make sure that Wine is installed, and OpenGL is your rendering selection!

***Depends on wine!***
***Also make sure that, when you open Firefox for the first time, DISABLE UPDATES.***

## Instructions:

1. Install dependencies
2. Make a folder called "go-work" in the root of your virtual c drive 
3. Set GOPATH to "C:\go-work" by opening "wine regedit" and going to "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Environment"
4. Run install.sh
5. Run the run.sh script to enjoy ROBLOX.
