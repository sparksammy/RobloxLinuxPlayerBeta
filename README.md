# RobloxLinuxPlayerBeta
It's forever in beta, just like the original. :)

Make sure that Wine is installed, and OpenGL is your rendering selection!

***Depends on wine!***
***Also make sure that, when you open Firefox for the first time, DISABLE UPDATES.***

## Instructions:

1. Install dependencies
2. Set GOPATH to "C:\Go" by opening "wine regedit" and going to "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Environment"
3. Run install.sh
4. Run the run.sh script to enjoy ROBLOX.
